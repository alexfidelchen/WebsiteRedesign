<div class="parallax_twoPeople"> <div class="caption caption2"> <h1 class="padding"> Our first 
collection centers around the idea of fluidity. It is an exploration on the 
power of context affecting identity and observing similarities between garments.<br>
Our clothes are tools for expression; not an expression in itself. These garments 
are formless without someone to wear it. Ideas of formality, fit and meaning are 
all relative. It depends on who, where and how, not it.<br>
There are remnants of many influences throughout the collection but none so
pervasive to ascertain a definitive aesthetic or mood. Without defining iconology, 
what details separates a tunic from a kurta or a bowling shirt from a pyjama shirt? 
What details are essential to its identity before a garment is left bare to 
be crafted into something new? We are all in a state of flux, changing, redefining 
and discovering ourselves.
